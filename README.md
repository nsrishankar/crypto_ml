# Machine Learning for Cryptography Simple Projects
_Will be looked into futher_

1. Project One: Implementation of a Perceptron using MNIST dataset and basic Python/Numpy following Michael Nielson's model
2. Project Two: Generation of adversarial images on Imagenet dataset
3. Project Three: Benchmarking model performance on side-channel attack data (Perfweb)
4. Project Four: Privacy Leakage analysis of location data through regression
